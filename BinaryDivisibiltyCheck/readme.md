# 🏴 CTF Challenge: Binary Line Counter  

## 📜 Description  
You have been given a file named `data.dat` containing **10,000** lines of binary strings (combinations of 0s and 1s). Some of these lines follow a hidden pattern, and your task is to **count only the lines that match a specific rule**.  

## 🔎 Challenge  
Can you uncover the hidden rule that determines which lines should be counted?  

## 💡 Hints  
1. **Break it down:** Try counting how many times `0` and `1` appear in a single line. Patterns often emerge in numbers.  
2. **Think in groups:** Some numbers form complete groups while others don’t. Consider simple mathematical properties that define these groups.  
3. **One or the other:** A line can qualify in more than one way. You don’t need both conditions—just one is enough.  

## 🚀 Objective  
Write a script to analyze `data.dat` and determine the exact number of valid lines. Once you have the correct count, you’ll have your flag!  

Good luck! 🔐🎯
